# ICD2O-Final-Project

Our final project is a chatbot application that integrates with an external AI toolâ€™s API to provide intelligent, real-time responses. The chatbot is capable of answering a range of simple queries, including basic math problems and questions related to current events. The primary goal is to demonstrate seamless API integration and practical use of AI to deliver relevant and accurate information through a conversational interface.
